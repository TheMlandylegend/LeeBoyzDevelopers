          >_Hello friends, my name is Jhoset and I am a software developer that likes to code in various programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C#, C++ and many more. I was born in Cali, Colombia,
           but moved to the United States when I was 15 years old. When I was 19, I started watching my first tutorials on youtube on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was really
           enjoying watching these tutorials so I decided to go back to school and getting a degree in Computer Programming.
           My main passion is to build websites and getting involved in both aspects of the development process such as front end development and back end development.
            Currently an intern at D & A LLC Innovative Software Solutions.
            At the moment I'm learning about web application using node.js, typescript, and react.js.
             Also learning about databases using PostgreSQL. When I am not programming, I like to read articles on the web that can
             expand my knowledge in computer science , exercise, and spend time with my family and friends.
